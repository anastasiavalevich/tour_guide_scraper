VALIDATOR_PROMPT = """
You are a strict validator for scraped pages of the Italian National Qualifying Exam for Tourist Guides (2025).

Input JSON schema:
{
  "topic": "slug",
  "pages": [
    {"title": str, "url": str, "content_markdown": str}
  ]
}

Validation rules (apply in this order):
1) Domain whitelist ONLY: .gov.it, ministeroturismo.gov.it, cultura.gov.it, inpa.gov.it, gazzettaufficiale.it, normattiva.it, any regione.* or comune.* portals.
   - Drop anything else.
2) Non-empty content: content_markdown must be non-empty and meaningful (>= 400 characters). Drop pages that are just menus, cookie banners, or empty.
3) Relevance to the topic (exact input "topic"): keep pages about the legal framework (law 190/2023, DM 88/2024, exam decree, official notices, inPA bando pages).
   - If off-topic, drop.
4) Deduplicate:
   - Same URL → keep one.
   - Near-duplicate content (substantially same text) → keep the most official/complete one.
5) Normalize:
   - Trim whitespace.
   - Shorten very long titles to a concise, meaningful form (<= 120 chars).

Output ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "topic": "slug",
  "pages": [
    {"title": "...", "url": "...", "content_markdown": "..."},
    ...
  ],
  "dropped": [
    {"url": "...", "reason": "not_whitelisted|empty|off_topic|duplicate"}
  ],
  "notes": [
    "short summary of what was kept and why (1-3 bullets)"
  ]
}
Do not include explanations outside JSON. Return JSON only.
